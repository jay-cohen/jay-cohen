            <p>Take Card was a company I founded back in 2015 to allow freelancers and small companies to accept mobile
                payments from clients. Itâ€™s feature list included invoice generation, user branding, PCI Compliance, basic
                accounting and recurring billing.</p>
            <p>I used the newly created Stripe Connect platform to handle user account creation along with Swift Vapor
                providing a middle layer for invoice creation, user management, analytics and client facing web interface.
                Mailgun handled the email processing sending various templates.</p>
