                <p>Sens’d is an app I built from audio I recorded when visiting Canada’s Kootenay National Park.  AudioKit was used as the engine along with a customised soundwave generator to suit the aestethics. It was a simple app that packed a big punch which helped to unwind and relax after a hard day at work or when feeling blue.</p>
