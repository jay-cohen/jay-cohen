                <h2>Years of experience<span class="color-three">.</span></h2>
                <p>I'm a freelance App developer and I've been building apps for clients for over 11 years in a wide range of sectors including, international sports brands, film studios, health, CRM, and not for profit. Based in the middle of the UK, I've worked with clients across the world.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I can be seen trekking in the outdoors with my family, working on a pilots license or trying to make any money from Cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <h2>Projects<span class="color-three">.</span></h2>
                <p>Most of the projects I've worked on are bound by NDA's which is how most freelancers work today. I do get a lot of work from recommendations, so my portfolio contains side projects to keep my skills fresh when new iOS feature's come out. I find this way works best and is more beneficial to my clients.</p>
                <p>I like to work in a very collaborative and open way, either working solo or part of a team tackling a larger problem. My code is always clean, well documented, and easily read by non technical people, should they want to have a play.</p>
