                        <p>I have worked with many developers over the years and working with Jay has been one of the best! He is very knowledgeable and whenever an issue arose he would discuss with me about the best possible solutions. I would recommend Jay's services in a heartbeat to anyone looking.</p>

                        <p>Jay joined us for a few months, which led to about 6 as a contract iOS developer. He worked diligently and fit in well with our team and our culture. Certainly more committed than most contractors in the market. More than comfortable in front of and leading client meetings. Would highly recommend.</p>

                        <p>I worked closely with Jay for 6 months on a ticket purchasing application. Jayâ€™s main area of expertise was developing the IOS app which he coded with confidence and met all the project milestones on time. His interpersonal skills were of great value to the projects progression and he was able to explain technical processes with ease to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
