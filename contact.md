                    <h2>Getting in touch</h2>
                    <p>If you’d like to reach me you can email using the big email link. If you can provide some details about your project and when you’re looking to hit the App Stores that would be fantastic. We can arrange a follow up call to get to know the project in detail and get started.</p>

                    <h4>Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>I work remotely, if you need me on site then this will be reflected in the day rate.  I’m happy to face-to-face meetings with an agreed timeframe to catch up and also help with discovery workshops. If a fixed cost is the best approach to your project I will require 50% at the start wtih the remaining upon completion. I also have some general faq’s.</p>
