                    <h3>Getting to know me...</h3>
                    <p>My favourite place is the Isle of Arran, there’s something about that place which relaxes you beyond words. I have a passion for agriculture and how mobile technology can assist in that space. My favourite brewery is Brew Dog and I’m gluten free (don’t let that put you off).</p>

                    <h3>Why mobile apps</h3>
                    <p>When the iPhone was released way back in 2008 I was working for agencies in London producing Flash content & websites for film companies such as Paramount Pictures & Universal Studios. I didn’t really take to the Objective-C language as I generally only like to say things once. 🤓</p>
                    <p>This all changed the moment Apple released Swift and one of my clients requested I build them an iOS app. I’d dabbled with Swift in the past but without a solid project to build it’s difficult to gain any true experience so I jumped at the chance. The build was a rollacoaster journey of learning, hair pulling and moments of joy throughout but when it finally hit the app store it was like all the pieces fell into place.</p>
                    <p>I successfully moved into iOS development full time 5 years ago in April. I occasionally build websites and back-end services for clients who need the “Whole package” but having got bitten by the iOS bug with my first client app many moons ago the only way is mobile!🕺🏻</p>
