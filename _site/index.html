                <h2>Years of experience<span class="color-three">.</span></h2>
                <p>I'm a freelance App developer and I've been building apps for clients for over 11 years in a wide range of sectors including international sports brands, film studios, health, CRM, and not for profit. Based in the middle of the UK, I've worked with clients across the world.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I can be seen trekking in the outdoors with my family, working on a pilots license or trying to make any money from Cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <h2>Projects<span class="color-three">.</span></h2>
                <p>Most of the projects I've worked on are bound by NDA's which is how most freelancers work today. I do get a lot of work from recommendations, so my portfolio contains side projects to keep my skills fresh when new iOS feature's come out. I find this way works best and is more beneficial to my clients.</p>
                <p>I like to work in a very collaborative and open way, either working solo or part of a team tackling a larger problem. My code is always clean, well documented, and easily read by non technical people, should they want to have a play.</p>

                        <p>Jay joined us for a few months, which led to about 6 as a contract iOS developer. He worked diligently and fit in well with our team and our culture. Certainly more committed than most contractors in the market. More than comfortable in front of and leading client meetings. Would highly recommend.</p>

Jayâ€™s main area of expertise was developing the IOS app which he coded with confidence and met all the project milestones on time. His interpersonal skills were of great value to the projects progression and he was able to explain technical processes with ease to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
