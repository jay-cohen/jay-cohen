                <p>Sens’d is an app I built from audio I recorded when visiting Canada’s Kootenay National Park.  AudioKit was used as the engine along with a customised soundwave generator to suit the aestethics. It was a simple app that packed a big punch which helped to unwind and relax after a hard day at work or when feeling blue.</p>

                <p>Pawey was an app to help train dogs, including my own. I hired a team of trainers to produce the course content introducing new lessons to teach obedience skills. The app was a great project to start and finsh and used almost all of the iOS functionality. The app started the training with the basics at first before working through Pre School, High School, College and Cheeky course content!</p>

                <p>I used the newly created Stripe Connect platform to handle user account creation along with Swift Vapor providing a middle layer for invoice creation, user management, analytics and client facing web interface. Mailgun handled the email processing sending various templates.</p>

                <p>Having built a few apps & websites in my career I had built a large collection of sounds for various user interactions and alerts.

Once the web page was designed and released on various market places it was also added to Product Hunt which achieved 2nd place for the day.</p>
