                produce the course content which introduced new lessons to teach obedience skills along the way. It was a great project from
                start to finsh and used almost all of the iOS functionality. The app started a dogs training with the basics 
                before working through Pre School, High School, College and as an added bonus, Cheeky course content!</p>

            <p>Take Card was a company I founded back in 2015 to allow freelancers and small companies to accept mobile
                payments from clients. It’s feature list included invoice generation, user branding, PCI Compliance, basic
                accounting and recurring billing.</p>
            <p>I used the newly created Stripe Connect platform to handle user account creation along with Swift Vapor
                providing a middle layer for invoice creation, user management, analytics and client facing web interface.
                Mailgun handled the email processing sending various templates.</p>

            <p>Sens’d is an app I built from audio I recorded when visiting Canada’s Kootenay National Park. AudioKit
                was used as the engine along with a customised soundwave generator to suit the aestethics. It was a
                simple app which helped to unwind and relax after a hard day.</p>

            <p>Having built a few apps & websites in my career I had built a large collection of sounds for various user
                interactions and alerts. In 2018 I decided to release them as a side project for anyone who could make
                use of them. Once the web page was designed and released on various market places it was also added to
                Product Hunt which achieved 2nd place for the day.</p>

            <p>Man do was one of the original projects I had coded in Objective-C way back in 2009. When Swift was

                taking app that offered a no fuss solution to storing and completing tasks.</p>
