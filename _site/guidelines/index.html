                    <p>Simply start by sending an email with your project details. We'll arrange a time to discuss the project in detail and how we can work great together, along with timelines, feedback points, and deliverables. Once the work is completed and you're happy for release on the App Store or pushed to your repository, we'll finalise the terms of our agreement or move on to the next feature.</p>

                    <h3>Why don't you create an Agency<span class="color-three">?</span></h3>
                    <p>With my skill set spread across all areas of digital I often get asked this question and the truth is I like to be mobile (no pun). Being an agency wouldn’t give me the freedom I’ve come to enjoy and depend on. This freedom helps me to return value for money to my clients and creative suggestions you wouldn’t necessarily get from being in an office.</p>

                    <h3>Can you work for equity<span class="color-three">?</span></h3>
                    <p>I’ve been asked this a few times, said yes and got burnt, said yes and it’s being a success but I’ve always come back to building apps and that’s what I enjoy the most. I don't work for equity anymore.</p>

                <div class="block">
                    <h3>Can you work with our tools<span class="color-three">?</span></h3>
                    <p>Yes, whatever Agile, Waterfall or RAD setup you have I've worked with the following Slack, Github, Bitbucket, Skype, Zoom, Jira, Trello, Zendesk and many others.</p>

                    <h3>Do you work for a fixed price<span class="color-three">?</span></h3>
                    <p>Sure, if that’s a way that helps you to control your spending. I can work to a fixed budget. I would need to know all the requirements of the project and from experience it's far easier if all the API endpoints have been completed before starting.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="block">
                    <h3>How much do projects cost<span class="color-three">?</span></h3>
                    <p>It totally depends on the project and its needs. A small project with a few screens or pages will cost significantly less than a large one. Previous small projects I have worked on have been around <b>£8000</b> and large projects have been roughly <b>£100,000</b>.</p>

                    <h3>Do you build Android apps<span class="color-three">?</span></h3>
                    <p>Yes, providing it's in Kotlin and isn't complex. I can interpolate Java but find with the similarites between Swift and Kotlin it's a lot easier to work with. I do know a great Android developer who'll I'll be happy to recommend and have worked with on multiple occasions.</p>
